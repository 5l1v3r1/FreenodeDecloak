## I cannot take credit for this, I found this in Google Cache Somewhere.

Using this script is very simple.

### Steps

1. Register a channel, 
You can do this by joining a random channel like ##KSJDFHK, and then running 
```
/msg chanserv register ##KSJDFHK
```

2. OP Everybody
And then op yourself

```
/msg chanserv op ##KSJDHK your_nick
/msg chanserv op ##KSJDHK bot_nick
```

3. Rejoice
Then join that channel and run `*decloak user`

I hope you have good yields! If you see any errors just elevate permissions on the bot
